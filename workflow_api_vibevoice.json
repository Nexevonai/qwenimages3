Yesterday it was "SuperMegaFlux," today it's "Quantum Banana," tomorrow who knows — maybe "AI that replaces your grandma!"\n\nI mean, can we just take a little break?\nLet me breathe, okay? Let America breathe!\n\nEvery morning my team says,\n"Sir, there's a new model!"\nAnd I say, "Another one?! I just learned the last one yesterday!"\n\nIt's crazy! Totally crazy!\nThese AIs — they're coming faster than Biden's speeches, and that's saying something!\n\nPlease, developers, slow down a little — let's check the dollar, see what China's doing… maybe even take a nap!\n\nBecause honestly, folks — we're tired.\nVery tired.\nThe best kind of tired — Trump tired!",
